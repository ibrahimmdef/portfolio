      <p>
        I’m a junior developer working to build a solid foundation in modern web
        development. My interest in software started with a simple curiosity
        about how the interfaces we use every day are actually built. Over time,
        that curiosity grew into learning both frontend and backend basics and
        creating small projects to improve my skills. <br /> <br />
        On the frontend, I focus on building clean, simple, and understandable
        interfaces. I pay attention to structure, clarity, and how a page flows
        from one element to another. I’m still early in my journey, but I’m
        improving step by step in areas like component-based development,
        responsive layouts, and basic UI interactions. <br /> <br />
        On the backend, I’m learning how data flows, how APIs function, and how
        to structure the core logic of an application. I have a basic
        understanding and continue to build on it by creating projects where the
        frontend and backend work together smoothly. <br /> <br />
        I’m aware that I have a lot to learn, and I don’t pretend otherwise. My
        goal right now isn’t to be perfect — it’s to keep improving, understand
        what I’m doing, and produce simple but functional projects. I try to
        learn by doing, fixing mistakes, and repeating the process until things
        make sense. <br /> <br />
        I’m committed to growing at a steady pace, learning real-world
        workflows, and becoming more confident in both frontend and backend
        development. For now, my focus is clear: strengthen the fundamentals and
        build practical, reliable solutions one step at a time.
